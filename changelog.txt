This file contains changes specific to the df-structures repo. See
docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo for a full description, or
https://docs.dfhack.org/en/latest/docs/Compile.html#build-changelog

NOTE: currently, gen_changelog.txt expects a "Future" section to exist at the
top of this file (even if no changes are listed under it), or you will get a
"Entry without section" error. Also, to maintain proper sorting in the generated
changelogs when making a new release, docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo must
have the new release listed in the right place, even if no changes were made in
that repo.

# Future

## Structures

# 50.13-r5

# 50.13-r4

## Structures
- ``world_site``: rename ``is_mountain_halls`` and ``is_fortress`` to Bay12 names ``min_depth`` and ``max_depth``

# 50.13-r3

## Structures
- ``plant_flags``: rename ``is_burning``, ``is_drowning``, ``is_dead`` to Bay12 names ``unused_01``, ``season_dead``, ``dead``
- ``job.item_category`` is now ``job.specflag``, contains a union of flag fields, and depends on the job type
- ``slab_engraving_type``: correct order of items (last two were swapped)
- ``unitst``: correct return type of ``create_nemesis`` vmethod
- ``world_data``: identify many fields and substructures
- added several bay12 exported entry points to list of known globals
- canonicalized a wide swath of type names, field names, and structure organization to match DF's internal names and organization. fields that already had useful names were largely left alone, but all ``unk``, ``anon``, and other "placeholder" names have been changed. structures that differed from reality were also corrected (e.g. collections of fields that were actually substructures and vice versa).
