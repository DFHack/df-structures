This file contains changes specific to the df-structures repo. See
docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo for a full description, or
https://docs.dfhack.org/en/latest/docs/Compile.html#build-changelog

NOTE: currently, gen_changelog.txt expects a "Future" section to exist at the
top of this file (even if no changes are listed under it), or you will get a
"Entry without section" error. Also, to maintain proper sorting in the generated
changelogs when making a new release, docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo must
have the new release listed in the right place, even if no changes were made in
that repo.

# Future

## Structures
- added missing field in history_event_artifact_createdst
- fixed incorrect base class on widget_anchored_tile

# 53.04-r1

## Structures
- several arrays indexed by enums have been recoded to use the enum's size to size the array so that these will automatically update when the enum is updated, reflecting Bay12 practice

# 52.03-r2

## Structures
- added default values for ``material`` and ``mat_index`` in ``reaction_reagentst`` and ``reaction_productst`` child classes
