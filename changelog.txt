This file contains changes specific to the df-structures repo. See
docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo for a full description, or
https://docs.dfhack.org/en/latest/docs/Compile.html#build-changelog

NOTE: currently, gen_changelog.txt expects a "Future" section to exist at the
top of this file (even if no changes are listed under it), or you will get a
"Entry without section" error. Also, to maintain proper sorting in the generated
changelogs when making a new release, docs/changelog.txt in the dfhack repo must
have the new release listed in the right place, even if no changes were made in
that repo.

# Future

## Fixes
- `embark-skills`: fixed an issue with structures causing the ``points`` option to do nothing

## Structures
- Added a new ``<df-other-vectors-type>``, which allows ``world.*.other`` collections of vectors to use the correct subtypes for items
- ``crime``: identified ``witnesses``, which contains the data held by the old field named ``reports``
- ``job_type``: added job types new to 0.47
- ``ui_advmode_menu``: identified some new enum items
- ``plant_raw``: material_defs now contains arrays rather than loose fields
- ``pronoun_type``: new enum (previously documented in field comments)
- ``creature_raw``: renamed ``gender`` to ``sex`` to match the field in ``unit``, which is more frequently used
- ``intrigue``: new type (split out from ``historical_figure_relationships``)
- ``setup_character_info``: fixed a couple alignment issues (needed by `embark-skills`)
- ``items_other_id``: removed ``BAD``, and by extension, ``world.items.other.BAD``, which was overlapping with ``world.items.bad``
