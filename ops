However, some of the fields have completely different values, only for field values to synchronize again, repeated several times. In addition to that, the \"replaced\" values in the older version does not reappear elsewhere, so it doesn't seem to be a simple rearrangement of fields.\n\nThus, I believer there's a need for an investigation into the actual layout of this structure.","files":null}]}
