This guess is currently based solely on the detection of such a value in a 0.44.11 save and that messengers are a new type of assignment that would fit in among the values present. So far no attempt has been made to actually check that guess.\n\nThe value was found in a df.global.world.occupations.all[*].type field.\n\nEdit: Manually assigning two messenger positions in the fortress looked at resulted in two new entries with a \"type\" field value of 6 in the df.global.world.occupations.all structure, so I think it's a reasonably safe assumption that 5 = MESSENGER.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"7c3935464acdaaae9d6fcb27abcbbe21ec75027f"},"timestamp":1530205900,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTcwNjg3MzczMA=="},"status":2}]}
