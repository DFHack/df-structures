I recently had the issue that an \"integer\" array was identified as containing enum values, and then had to jump through hoops to get the schema validation to accept a reworked description that represented the information. Obviously, the schema should reject cases that aren't supported by the code generation, so a changed schema should be backed up by the code generation.","files":null}]}
