No obvious correlation. I've found evil reanimation both with a value of 0 and a value of 256, and I've seen both 0 and 256 on good regions. I've also found one oddball case of an evil region with a value of 61. It can also be noted that this field has data in it before DF generates evil weather (immediately after good/evil is generated).","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"dc07f1dff8eee6d97a060efd0e58b122b9009d24"},"timestamp":1511971129,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM2MzgzMDUyNw=="},"status":2}]}
