The enums have the \"same\" values in the same order. The mixed case enums in the former type have different names with broadly the same meaning in some cases ('Jungle' vs 'FOREST', 'Steppe' vs 'GRASSLAND'). Since the latter enum's values match what's used by DF itself through the world generation files, that is probably the type that should remain.","files":null}]}
