The `rating` values have been unbounded for some time, I think, and I'm not sure what the `experience` cutoffs above `Legendary5` are.\n\nActually, if you were looking at the xp_threshold attribute of skill_rating, that's the experience needed _beyond_ the current level to get to the next level - e.g. once you're `Skilled`, you need 900 more XP to become `Proficient`. My logic might be off by one or so, but [here](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/blob/55a82e43c6838849417723780be4f09f048d6b0b/plugins/manipulator.cpp#L2071) is a possibly-relevant place in manipulator where this is displayed - you'll probably be able to find e.g. \"Skilled (400/900)\" dwarves.","files":null}]}
