When a unit transforms into a different creature as a result of a syndrome effect, a unit_wound is created to store the effect in wound_curse_info. Within this, `were_race` and `were_curse` should of course respectively contain the race and caste IDs pertaining to the transformation. However, I have observed that the race ID is being displayed in `were_caste` instead, with the real caste ID seemingly missing.","files":null}]}
