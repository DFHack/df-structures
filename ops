The results were:\nRainfall/Vegetation (same value for both): Text for \"Trees:\"\n0: None (Light Red)\n1 - 9: Scarce (Yellow)\n10 - 32: Scarce (Light Grey)  --  i.e. same text, but different color\n33 - 65: Woodland (Light Green)\n66 - 100: Heavily Forested (Green)\n\nAnd for \"Other Vegetation:\"\n0: None (Light Red)\n1 - 9: Scarce (Yellow)\n10 - 65: Moderate (Light Grey)\n66 - 100: Thick (Light Green)\n\nI tried 0 and 100 Drainage on the boundary Rainfall/Vegetation values in addition to the original one (whatever that was), but the boundaries did not shift, indicating Drainage does not affect the result. Note that the investigation was done on a tropical tile, but I don't expect temperate tiles to behave any different.\n\nIt can also be noted that actual embark experience with very low Rainfall/Vegetation values were somewhat different. If I remember correctly (it was a few years ago), a Rainfall of 0-1 resulted in no growth of any (surface) vegetation post embark (farm plots still worked), 2-4 (or 5?) resulted in growth of shrubs but no saplings, and higher values allowed saplings to appear as well. One embark had \"Scarce\" trees consisting of a single Feather Tree (not a Saguaro, luckily) on embark and no saplings. Thus, the pre embark info doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nFinally, I haven't embarked to check DF's pre embark info against the actual situation, but any tree regrowth will result in an end state of complete junglification anyway.","files":null}]}
