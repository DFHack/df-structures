However, in my 0.44.12 fortress there are a lot of things that would be cooked only as the result of losing a bet, such as artifact item_toolst with written contents, item_flaskst, item_cagest, item_bucketst, , item_barrelst, and item_boxst (in addition to a lot of things that can probably be cooked, such as e.g. seeds, eggs, drinks, and misc powders [\"probably\" means I haven't looked deeper to verify the particular seeds are of a cookable kind, etc.]).\nI have no theory of what the vector is supposed to contain, though, as all the flasks in my fortress are vials (so it can't be organic).","files":null}]}
