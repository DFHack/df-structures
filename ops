On the eastern and southern sides there are no corner values guiding the process, and corners consistently end up behaving as there was a corner definition of 0, resulting in the eastern side getting their NE corner data from the north and the southern side getting their SW corner from the west.\nThe western and northern world edges show a more complex corner behavior as there are actual corner definitions available. On the northern side a corner value of 0, and 2 resulted in the western tile being used, while 1 and 3 selected the eastern one. This is the exception to the rule, as 1 is interpreted as 3 rather than 2, favoring the WE direction indication (bit?) over the numeric order. For the western side, 0 and 1 resulted in the northern biome being selected, while 2 and 3 selected the southern one.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"7c3935464acdaaae9d6fcb27abcbbe21ec75027f"},"timestamp":1563766952,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzYyODg4MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/DFHack/df-structures/issues/323#issuecomment-513628880"},"message":"\u003e - gui/gm-editor displays inconsistent information about split_x and split_y:\n\u003e  - split_x  coord2d[17], while expanded the range is 0-15 of coord2d[17] (which has 17 entries)\n\u003e  - split_y coord2d[16], while expanded the range is 0-16, of coord2d[16] (which has 16 entries)\n\nAre you saying that the type name displayed for these fields is giving the wrong array length?
