The first one of those has a ref_aux value of 0, while the other ones have a value of 5.\nComparing the references with the DF display of the codex contents indicates that the 3 non zero ref_aux entries correspond to the codex' 3 chapters.\n\nI've only seen 5 as a non zero ref_aux value (chapter?), but haven't looked at it in any kind of depth. My guess is that the zero reference is the work overall, while non zero ones are parts of the work.\nMy codex thus holds info about a goblin civ on the top level, with two chapters on the acceptance of peace treaties and one of the appointment of a general.","files":null}]}
