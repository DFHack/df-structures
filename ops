Some books, like encyclopedias have multiple main topics. However, only the manual seems to teach anything. I suspect the learning about sites/people/regions/figures/events from books (and slabs, now I think about it), is not implemented at the moment.\n1-4 I have not seen.\n5 is for chronicles, biographies, autobiographies and cultural histories, the events here get written down as 'the first chapter concerns event x', so I suspect these are about chapters within a work.\n6 is for poems, seems to in particular be about the values these espouse??? I can't find the description text of poems which have these refs.\n7 is referencing poetry, this happens with musical compositions. Can be multiple.\n8 is for choreographies, and references music compositions.\n9 is for when academic works espouse a value.\n\nI am still trying to figure out how value in written content exactly functions. I doubt only essays and dialogs (which have values as their main topic) adjust personal values. It's a bit tricky: histfigs mostly really like writing manuals and poems, and only manuals are bound to be written onto something.","files":null}]}
