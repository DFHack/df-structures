However, it turned out quite a few scrolls and books have itemimprovement_pagest or itemimprovement_writingst improvements without having this flag set. The flag isn't correlated with one of these improvement types, as both types have been seen together with both flag values, nor have I've seen any correlation with whether the content references something or not (again, both flag values have been seen with and without contents references).","files":null}]}
