One of them only has a single entry, which is identical to anon_8, the other one has a single entry which is not correlated with any particular entry in the artifact record.\n\nartifact_record.anon_11 contains a list of historical figure IDs, probably known past/current holders of the artifact--current holder's hist fig ID is always an entry in the vector, and is sometimes (but not always) the sole entry.\n\nartifact_record.anons_12-16 appear to just be duplicated anons_4-8--no cases where the two are different in 774 artifacts.\n\nartifact_record.anon_17 is always 250, at least in the world I'm testing. I don't know what's up with that.\n\nartifact_record.anon_19 is 3 for artifacts, 4 for codices etc. and 1000000 (!!) for a single artifact, The Glove of Chains, which is unique (as far as I could find) in being destroyed.\n\nartifact_record.flags[1] and artifact_record.flags[2] are related to artifacts being lost/destroyed--every artifact i found which had both flags was lost. The Glove of Chains, which was destroyed, has neither, and indeed no flags set.\n\nNot a pull request because pending more testing.","files":null}]}
