I looked at a random embark that, unfortunately, ended up having two biomes rather than one (my layer examination looks only at the biome of the embark world tile).\n4 small cluster gem types were found in the same layer of the 3*3 embark's geo biome and 'prospect all' was used to get the actual count.\nName vein_unk_38 actual count\nSmoky Quartz;      23; 346\nGreen Tourmaline; 56; 608\nClear Zircon;          26; 369\nOpal Redflash;        73; 955\nA guess is that the number roughly controls the number of clusters/veins and that random development of those yield the exact numbers. The lowest number I've seen was 3 and the highest was 100, so a further guess is that it's a percentage.","files":null}]}
