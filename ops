They're sort of compound objects rather than material in the way e.g. MEAT is (and I believe non vermin fish can be butchered to yield MEAT rather than FISH). Looking at the referenced file, REMAINS and VERMIN behave the same (although I don't think you can prepare meals from them, apart from Creepy Crawler MEAT after butchering). CORPSE and CORPSEPIECE are other compound object oddballs.\nI don't think there's a need to change anything. However, additional comments usually don't hurt (although they're frequently not read anyway)...","files":null}]}
