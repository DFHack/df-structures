Thus, the types of these fields should probably be reversed.\n\nEdit: The results above are valid for civ entities. For site governments these fields are used for something completely different, as unk14 was displayed as nil (=0) and unk15 had various very low \"pointer\" values (2, 77, 79) that were still usually too large to be region or landmass indices for the test world.","files":null}]}
