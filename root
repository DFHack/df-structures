In addition to that, the XP thresholds may have been adjusted as well, given that a randomly selected skill (Mason) with a value of 26 is listed at 1196 XP, corresponding to Talented according to the XML. Competent (3) = 444 XP, Skilled (4) = 824 XP.\nNo. There is only a weak correlation between the skill rating and experience value on units (skill level 16 has at least one unit with 0 experience, for instance), so I don't think you can look at units to draw any conclusions.\n\nNeeds further investigation.","files":null}]}
