One example is the bowyer coming in at number 49, right past siege engineers (47) and operators (48). Umbrella professions like metalsmith and woodworker don't have their own number, but instead contain all the identifiers of their sub-professions. For instance, woodworkers have 2 (carpenter), 1 (woodcutter) and 49 (bowyer) in that order. \nOn the surface it seems just like a big list of which skill means which profession and what umbrella term gets used when skills x, y and z are all present. Of course, the fact that this only went in with version 0.40 suggests that it's got more to do with the living history feature than everyday practice.\n\n1b is weirder. The list format is the same, but most civilian professions are blank. The only values are located in the following list items, with all the values listed in order:\n- rangers and hunters (44, 105)\n- doctors, diagnosers, bone setters, suturers and surgeons (59)\n- hammer/spear/axe/swords-/mace/whipmen (105, 45, 46, 88, 116, 89)\n- blowgun/bow/crossbow/pikemen (105, 46, 88, 116, 89)\n- wrestlers (105, 88, 116, 89)\n\nTranslated into human language, hunters have CROSSBOW and DODGING, medical professions all get WOUND_DRESSING and nothing more (notable since the distinct wound dresser profession isn't listed at all!), melee fighters aside from pikemen get DODGING, SHIELD, ARMOR, DISCIPLINE, CLIMBING and SITUATIONAL_AWARENESS, archers and pikemen have all the above except for SHIELD and wrestlers lose ARMOR as well. \nThis seems like it lists all the secondary skills that don't really have a job title as such, but are intimately connected to the profession and would go up as well during their simulated careers.\n\nManually mangling these lists at any point from in-game to just before worldgen doesn't seem to do anything, not in gameplay or in during history generation. What exactly is looking at these lists?","files":null}]}
