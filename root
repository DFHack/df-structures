I've tried to make sense of them, but the numbers are too large both for the world tile and MLT scales. However, they may match a scale of 3 * 16 * world tile (i.e. number of map blocks), which is something I haven't encountered anywhere else.\n\nDoes anyone know what the previous thoughts about the coordinate system used in this context were?","files":null}]}
