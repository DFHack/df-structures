For the first three, the creature token `APP_MOD_NOUN`'s first argument describes the noun to use, and the second is whether it should be singular or plural (internally, a value of 0 is used for singular, 1 for plural). For tissue style, it's the creature token `TSU_NOUN`, with the same arguments. However in the structures, the names assigned vary, even when describing the same thing:\n### `bp_appearance_modifier`\nNoun label: `noun`\nPlural label: `single_plural`\n### `body_appearance_modifier`\nNoun label: `noun`\nPlural label: ? (maybe `anon_1` or `anon_2`?)\n(Note that body descriptions are handled as special cases by the game, so these don't get used anyway, to my knowledge)\n### `color_modifier_raw`\nNoun label: `part`\nPlural label: `unk_6c`\n### `tissue_styles_raw`\nNoun label: `noun`\nPlural label: `word_type`\n\n(All these can be found within `df.creature-raws.xml`)","files":null}]}
