I have no idea why gui/gm-editor displays the wrong size along the first dimension, instead displaying the same value as the second one.\n\nIs the dimension of the entries completely verified, and is there a way to verify them? The reason for the question is that biome_corner would have to be 17 * 17 to allow for the complete 16*16 set of mid level tiles to be defined, edge wise. With only 16*16 the southernmost and easternmost edges and corners of the southernmost and easternmost row/column are left undefined.\n\nAs an aside, the following might be a better description of the corresponding part of the file (comments changed and added some comment text):\n\"          \u003cstatic-array name='biome_corner' count='16'\n                          comment='0=Reference is NW, 1=Reference is N, 2=Reference is W, 3=Reference is current tile'\u003e\n                \u003cstatic-array type-name='int8_t' count='16'/\u003e\n            \u003c/static-array\u003e\n            All 4 corners touching get the same reference, i.e. SE corner of the tile to the NW,\n            SW corner of the tile to the N, NE corner of the tile to the W, and the NW corner\n            of the current tile, as directed by this value.\n            \u003cstatic-array name='biome_x' count='16' comment='0=Reference is N, 1=Reference is current tile (adopted by S edge to the N)'\u003e\n                \u003cstatic-array type-name='int8_t' count='16'/\u003e\n            \u003c/static-array\u003e\n            \u003cstatic-array name='biome_y' count='16' comment='0=Reference is W, 1=Reference is current tile (Adopted by E edge to the W)'\u003e\n                \u003cstatic-array type-name='int8_t' count='16'/\u003e\n            \u003c/static-array\u003e\n \"","files":null}]}
