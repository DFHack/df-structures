It seems like the material type field is a caste number and the material index field is the creature index. Reversing the fields (putting the type in the index field and the index in the type field) also works, but I think that is because a creature material type is the same as its creature index?\n\nWould it be possible that these fields are unions or something?\n\nAre there any other item types that cause this behaviour?","files":null}]}
