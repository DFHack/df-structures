Here are a few invalid vectors and pointers I found on v0.47.02 linux64 using df-structures 424ccedfcde133b295d11a8ff4638cefaf167c6d.\n\n- [ ] `unit_soul.performance_skills` (`0x100000001` for my dwarves, not a valid pointer)\n- [ ] `army_controller.unk_44` (vector pointers are `0xffffffffffffffff`, `0xffffffffffffffff`, `0x0`)\n- [ ] `world_region.forces` (different values, one example: `0x1400000004`, `0x20000001b`, `0x3c090000000008`)\n- [ ] `world.features.feature_global_idx`, this one could be a valid vector but not of int32_t (size 18 bytes, capacity 32 bytes).\n- [ ] `world.features.anon_1`, a vector too but not of pointers (size 36 bytes, capacity 64 bytes)","files":null}]}
