The field has a value of 1 for Evil regions, 0 for Neutral ones, and 256 for Good ones. World gen hacking showed that goblins refused to spawn (i.e. place their starting site) in formerly Good regions where all world tiles were converted to Evil, but this field was left unchanged at 256. Doing the same but changing the field value to 1 caused them to spawn. Going one step further to set the field to the value of 257 caused goblins to spawn only if the world tiles were also Evil.\n\nFailed investigations:\nIt can be noted that unk_1e4 seems to have a value of either 0 or 256, but I found no correlation between Savagery and this field, however.\n\nunk_98, unk_9c, and unk_a0 seem to have a value of at most the number of world tiles of the region, but I don't have any good lead on what properties they would track.","files":null}]}
