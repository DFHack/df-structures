Some books, like encyclopedias have multiple main topics. However, only the manual seems to teach anything. I suspect the learning about sites/people/regions/figures/events from books (and slabs, now I think about it), is not implemented at the moment.\n1-4 I have not seen.\n5 is for chronicles, biographies, autobiographies and cultural histories, the events here get written down as 'the first chapter concerns event x', so I suspect these are about chapters within a work.\n6 is for poems, seems to in particular be about the values these espouse???
