Thus, when placed_civs is set you can then see the site list being populated and sites starting to appear on the map.\nThe setting of these flags also coincides with DF displaying similar messages about commencing those tasks.\n\nEdit: The fields 'width' and 'height' seem to be misleading as well. As far as I can see they are actually world map cursor position x and y respectively. When world gen was paused, these fields matched the position of the cursor, and changing the value of these fields moved the cursor.\n\nEdit2: The fields anon_28 and anon_29 seems to be the number of civilizations and the number of civilizations left to place. These fields are probably valid only during the civ placement phase, with anon_28 having a value of -1 at the start of the phase.","files":null}]}
